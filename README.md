## What do I need?
A piano keyboard with MIDI output, plugged into a computer running your favorite Python interpreter.

## Features (current release)

- **MIDI import**: import your songs from standard MIDI files
- **Bookmarking**: navigate quickly from one important section to the other without scrolling through the entire song
- **_fingersatz_ edition**: edit and display the finger to use for each note
- **Looped practice**: define a complex section you want to practice, play it on repeat
- **Single hand practice**: practice the left or right hand only
- **Key highlighting**: highlight the notes associated to the current key of the song (Cmaj, Dmin, etc.) Highlighting changes dynamically if there are key changes
- **Readable work file**: annotated score, bookmarks, fingersatz, ... are saved in a human readable '.pr' file (JSON)
- **Combo counter**: keep track of the number of correct notes played in a row
- **Quick find**: a given chord whose location is unknown can be found just pressing the query chord on the MIDI keyboard.
- **Perfect loop practice**: in looped practice, progress can be reset as soon as a mistake is made üòà
- **Lookahead view**: the keyboard shows the notes to be pressed, but also the upcoming ones with different shades for improved 'sightreading'. Lookahead distance can be adjusted.
- **Built-in metronome**: practice with perfect timing.
- **Unbound looped practice**: define a start point and try to play from it on. Any mistake sends you back to the starting point.
- **Direct view on the real score**: import the real score and have it displayed while playing.

## Upcoming features (one day)

- **Enhanced _fingersatz_ edition**: more shortcuts, make it quicker and easier to edit
- **More complete playing statistics**: provide some hindsight on the overall playing performance of a song
- **Dynamic comments display**: a comment, or notes show at a certain cursor, for a certain section, like a copilot
- **Flexible MIDI loading**: select the specific tracks you want to import (MIDI might have way more than 2)
- **Metronome with dynamic tempo**: tempo is adjusted automatically throughout the score. It also helps to monitor your playing speed, hence your progress
- **Semi-automated _fingersatz_ edition**: simplify the assignation of repeated sections (repeated chords, codas, etc.)
- **Auto-highlight of the complex sections**: in the staffScope view, a color code shows the section that caused the most trouble, based on the playing statistics
- **Time accuracy score display**: shows how well you play the notes at the right time
