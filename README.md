# gangQin (v1.3)
Piano learning app, for those who can't read music scores.

## Features (current release)
- **MIDI import**: scores can be imported from standard MIDI files
- **Bookmarking**: navigate quickly from one important section to the other without scrolling the entire song
- **_fingersatz_**: edit and display the finger to use for each note
- **Loop practice**: define a complex section you want to practice, play it on repeat
- **Single hand practice**: practice the left or right hand only
- **Key highlight**: highlight the notes associated to the current key of the song. Highlighting changes dynamically if there are key changes
- **Readable work file**: annotated score, bookmarks, fingersatz, ... are saved in a human readable file (JSON)
- **Combo counter**: keep track of the number of correct notes played in a row
- **Quick find**: a given chord whose location is unknown can be found just pressing the query chord on the MIDI keyboard.
- **Perfect loop practice**: in loop practice, progress can be reset as soon as a mistake is made üòà
- **Lookahead view**: the keyboard shows the notes to be pressed, but also the upcoming ones with different shades for improved 'sightreading'. Lookahead distance can be adjusted.

## Upcoming features
- Enhanced fingersatz edition, with more shortcuts
- 'heading' indicator, pointing for each hand the direction they are about to aim to
- Dynamic comments display, updated based on the location in the score
- Relative difficulty display (based on user playing info analysis)
